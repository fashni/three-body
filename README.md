# Three-Body Problem Simulation
## Overview
This is a simple program to simulate a three-body system gravitational interaction which has no general analytic solution, yet, and can only be solved using a numerical approach. This project was made as the midterm exam substitute for my Simulation and Modelling class and was made using GUIDE on MATLAB® R2019b.
## Basic Concept
TBA
## How to Use
Make sure you have MATLAB® installed and simply run the "Three_body_Problem_Simulation.m" script, then input the parameter values in the given fields.

The units are as follows:
 - Mass → mass of Earth
 - Position → aphelion of Earth (the farthest distance between Earth and the Sun)
 - Velocity → Earth's orbital speed at aphelion (Earth's minimum orbital speed)
 - Time step → day

Then click "Calculate Orbit" button and wait until it completes before showing the simulation by clicking on the "Start Simulation" button.

> You can also load a demo file from the folder "saved" and click the "Start Simulation" button.
